## Summary

I work with single-celled microscopic microeukaryotes, also referred to as protists. My project uses molecular techniques (metabarcoding) to understand a community of protists in a given sample from the environment. The data I am working with currently are from tide pools near the coast of Acadia National Park, Maine. We collected 500 mL of water from different tide pools and I am asking what protists are inside those different samples of water among the tide pools sampled. We extract DNA and RNA from the community, sequence the genetic material, and then assign “OTUs” (species) to the sequence. So one tide pool sample can give rise to hundreds of OTUs (hundreds of different protists).
